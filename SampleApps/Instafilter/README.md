## How property wrappers become structs

SwiftUI let's us:

- store changing data in `@State` property wrapper
- Bind to a value in a control using `$`
- Redraw the view when the state changes

But what if we want to do more than just update the view when a `@State` value changes. What if we want to run a method, or print something out as part of a debug process.

What won't something like this work?

```swift
@State private var blurAmount = 0.0 {
    didSet {
        print("New value is \(blurAmount)")
    }
}
```

The reason why we don't get any print values here when we adjust the slider is because this `didSet` isn't the real underlying value. 

What we get here in this property observers is the `binding` to that value (i.e. `State<Double>`). The real value behind the binding is `wrappedValue`.

@State property wrapper itself is a struct:

```swift
@propertyWrapper struct State<Value> : DynamicProperty { ... }
```

The underlying value is a nonmutating set:

```swift
public var wrappedValue: Value { get nonmutating set }
```

Which means when we go `didSet` on `blurAmount` we are never triggering the change to the underlying value. That only happens on real UI events.

So how can to run some code every time a bound @State object changes? ðŸ¤” For that we have `onChange()`.

## Responding to state changes using onChange()

Because we can't detect or trigger a change in SwiftUI bindings like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var blurAmount: CGFloat = 0.0 {
        didSet {
            print("New value is \(blurAmount)")
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, World!")
                .blur(radius: blurAmount)

            Slider(value: $blurAmount, in: 0...20)
        }
    }
}
```

We can instead use the `onChange()` modifier like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var blurAmount = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, World!")
                .blur(radius: blurAmount)

            Slider(value: $blurAmount, in: 0...20)
                .onChange(of: blurAmount) { newValue in
                    print("New value is \(newValue)")
                }
        }
    }
}
```

On change wil fire everytime that underlying wrappedValue changes. And will give us a hook into running code when values change.

### Showing multiple options with confirmationDialog()

ShiftUI gives us:

- `alert()` for showing one or two button pop-ups
- `sheet()` for presenting whole views
- `confirmationDialog()` which is like an alert but with more buttons

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingConfirmation = false
    @State private var backgroundColor = Color.white

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
            .background(backgroundColor)
            .onTapGesture {
                showingConfirmation = true
            }
            .confirmationDialog("Change background", isPresented: $showingConfirmation) {
                Button("Red") { backgroundColor = .red }
                Button("Green") { backgroundColor = .green }
                Button("Blue") { backgroundColor = .blue }
                Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
            } message: {
                Text("Select a new color")
            }
    }
}
```
