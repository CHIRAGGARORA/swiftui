# Defining a var does not return a view

Say you define a rectangle.

And here is a rectangle with a button embedded in a `VStack`.

And then you make it a var. It disappears ðŸŽ©!

That's because you are no longer returning a view. You are defining a `var`. To make it return the view add a modifier, thereby returning a new view. Then all will work out.

# Modifier order matters

When learning SwiftUI, a good mental trick to help understand what's going on is that every time you all a view modifier you get a new view.

> This isn't what actually happens as that wouldn't be performant. But it's a useful mental model.

The second thing to appreciate is that the order you add the modifiers matters.

Here you can see the outmost yellow modifier is the one that shades the outmost layer of the view. So if you are ever confused about why you are going `.fill()` and it covers your entire view (and not the smaller view inside) check your view modifier order.
