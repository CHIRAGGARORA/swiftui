# TabView

Basic tab view.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Text("The First Tab")
                .badge(10)
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "1.square.fill")
                    Text("First")
                }
            Text("Another Tab")
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "2.square.fill")
                    Text("Second")
                }
            Text("The Last Tab")
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "3.square.fill")
                    Text("Third")
                }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

Which can also be paged and used like a page view controller.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            FirstView()
            SecondView()
            ThirdView()
        }
        .tabViewStyle(.page)
    }
}

struct FirstView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("View 1")
    }
}

struct SecondView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("View 2")
    }
}

struct ThirdView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("View 3")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

## Programmatically Selecting Tabs

1. Create an `@State` property to track the tab that is currently showing.
2. Modify that property to a new value whenever we want to jump to a different tab.
3. Pass that as a binding into the `TabView`, so it will be tracked automatically.
4. Tell SwiftUI which tab should be shown for each value of that property.

Steps 1-3 are easy. Step 4 is a bit more complicated. SwiftUI doesn't treat tabs as an array to be referenced by an index.

Instead you assign a unique identifier known as a `tag` to each tab, and access the tabs that way.

Here is how we can programmatically switch to Tab 2 after gesturing on Tab 1.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedTab = 0

    var body: some View {
        TabView(selection: $selectedTab) {
            Text("Tab 1")
                .onTapGesture {
                    self.selectedTab = 1
                }
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "star")
                    Text("One")
                }
                .tag(0)

            Text("Tab 2")
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "star.fill")
                    Text("Two")
                }
                .tag(1)
        }
    }
}
```

> Tip: Itâ€™s common to want to use NavigationView and TabView at the same time, but you should be careful: TabView should be the parent view, with the tabs inside it having a NavigationView as necessary, rather than the other way around.
